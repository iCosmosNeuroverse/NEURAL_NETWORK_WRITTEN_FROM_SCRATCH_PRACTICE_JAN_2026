# NEURAL_NETWORK_WRITTEN_FROM_SCRATCH_PRACTICE_JAN_2026

# Today, I write a fundamental artificial neural network from scratch/memory, in about 1000 lines of java code, without Ai libraries, [as I have been doing for 8 years, approximately every 6 months](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE).
# This is a part of [my Live agile neural network sessions](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Live-Agile-Artificial-Neural-Network-Programming-Sessions/blob/main/README.md), and [the ai curriculum](https://icognium.github.io/) that I teach.

# Modern ai, like GPT are powered by artificial neural networks, at bottom, similar to this fundamental model I wrote/practice writing from memory/sratch every 6 months or so. Granted those systems have neural nets that are alot more complicated than this basic one, but knowing this basic one both code wise and or [mathematically](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Neural-Networks-Kids-intuitive-ebook/dp/B077FX57ZZ) can help with debugging. 

# ~~To really write something from scratch, I would need to create a universe, chips, Os, ide, then finally the code without ml libraries like I did here, or take the organic root and "write" some humanoids with bilogical neural networks, but let's take scratch to mean the second to last item in the list, i.e. write a basic neural net without explicit neural net libraries like tensorflow or mxnet.

NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE_2026_JAN_5
Simple artificial neural network written from memory/scratch by Cosmos Bennett in java.

  Author: Cosmos Bennett
  
  Why?: This is practice writing of basic neural network from memory. ([I do this at the end of each year, or sometimes every 6 months](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE), for practice of fundamentals.)

  The problem space is [X-OR inputs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate). So the model does xor input prediction.
  
  Given two numbers in [X-OR space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate), the model will try to guess the output.
  
  For:
  
  a) Input=(0,0) output should be 0
  
  b) Input=(1,0) output should be 1
  
  c) Input=(0,1) output should be 1
  
  d) Input=(1,1) output should be 0
